        1. Read carefully the text.
        2. Extract the category or categories of clothes the customer is looking for, it can be:
            - t-shirt if the custimer is looking for a t-shirt.

            - shirt if the customer is looking for a shirt.
        3. If the customer is looking for multiple items of the same category, return the number of items we should retrieve. If not specfied but the user asked for more than 1, return 2.
        4. If the customer is looking for multiple category, the number of items should be 1.
        5. Return a valid JSON with the categories found, the key must be 'category' and the value must be a list with the categories found and 'number_of_items' with the number of items we should retrieve.

        Provide the output as a valid JSON object without any additional formatting, such as backticks or extra text. Ensure the JSON is correctly structured according to the schema provided below.
