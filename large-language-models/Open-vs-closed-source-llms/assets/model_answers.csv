As a result, the continental mass of East Antarctica is held at lower temperatures, while the peripheral areas, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, experience higher temperatures. This temperature difference promotes accelerated melting in the peripheral areas.","The cooling of the local stratosphere due to ozone depletion can intensify the westerly winds (polar vortex) around Antarctica. This strengthened vortex prevents the outflow of cold air near the South Pole, keeping the East Antarctic ice sheet at lower temperatures.

This leads to lower temperatures over the East Antarctic ice sheet, maintaining its stability and size, while peripheral areas like the Antarctic Peninsula experience higher temperatures, promoting accelerated melting. Additionally, these conditions contribute to an increase in sea ice around the continent.","The wind changes due to cooling in Antarctica can cause two main effects on the ice:

1. It prevents the outflow of cold air near the South Pole, which keeps the East Antarctic ice sheet at lower temperatures.

2. It subjects peripheral areas, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, to higher temperatures, which promotes accelerated melting.

Additionally, these wind changes are thought to contribute to the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.","The cooling caused by ozone depletion over Antarctica intensifies the westerly winds around the continent (the polar vortex). This prevents the outflow of cold air from the South Pole, resulting in lower temperatures over the East Antarctic ice sheet.

",Intensification of the polar vortex and prevention of outflow of cold air near the South Pole.,accelerated melting,"Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.",What can the wind changes due to cooling cause in the Antarctic ice?

In the Western Church, before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other. Nails are almost always depicted in art, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross. The tradition also carries to Christian emblems, e.g. the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion.","According to some sources, what is theorized to be the maximum nails used?"

",The Kinks,The Kinks,"In the 1960s, American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming, and louder vocals, from electric blues. Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf, The Kingsmen's version of ""Louie Louie"" (1963) which made it a garage rock standard, and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts, including ""You Really Got Me"" by The Kinks (1964), ""My Generation"" by The Who (1965), ""Shapes of Things"" (1966) by The Yardbirds and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" (1965) by The Rolling Stones. From the late 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music that emerged from psychedelia into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. In contrast, hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity.","Who recorded ""You Really Got Me""?"

This is evident in the structure of Hindu states, where the state is composed of institutions such as governance, administration, defense, law and order, while religion is represented by the Chief Priest of the King, who is a separate entity from the King, Prime Minister, and Commander in Chief.","In the context of Indian political philosophy, a clear distinction between nation and state is seen in the way that the state's institutions were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions, and were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. The nation, on the other hand, would refer to the people and culture as a whole, which may have influenced the state's policies and institutions but was distinct from it.

Similarly, religion and state were also demarcated, as the institutions of state did not include religious figures or bodies, and the principal governing body, Mantranga, did not include any religious leaders except for the Chief Priest of the King, who was primarily responsible for the King's religious duties. This suggests that religion was not a dominant factor in the state's governance and administration, and the state was not used as an instrument to promote or enforce any particular religion.","The Indian political philosophy of ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between nation and state, as well as religion and state. However, the context provided does not explicitly mention how this distinction was made.

In general, a nation is a group of people who share a common identity, history, culture, and language, while a state is a political entity with a defined territory, government, and sovereignty. The distinction between the two lies in the fact that a nation is a cultural and social entity, while a state is a political and legal entity.

Similarly, the distinction between religion and state lies in the separation of religious institutions and beliefs from the political and legal institutions of the state. In ancient Hindu states, the institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order, and religion was not explicitly mentioned as a separate institution. This suggests that religion was not a central organizing principle of the state, and that there was a clear separation between religious and political institutions.

",Charles A. Shibell,Charles A. Shibell,"From 1877 to 1878, the area suffered a rash of stagecoach robberies. Most notable, however, were the two holdups committed by masked road-agent William Whitney Brazelton. Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station approximately 17 mi (27 km) northwest of Tucson. John Clum, of Tombstone, Arizona fame was one of the passengers. Brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed on Monday August 19, 1878, in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River 3 miles (5 km) south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell and his citizen's posse. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery not only in the Tucson area, but also in the Prescott region and Silver City, New Mexico area as well. Brazelton's crimes prompted John J. Valentine, Sr. of Wells, Fargo & Co. to send special agent and future Pima County sheriff Bob Paul to investigate. Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, was established to help protect settlers from Apache attacks. In 1882, Frank Stilwell was implicated in the murder of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence's wife, Marietta, at the coroner's inquest on Morgan Earp's shooting. The coroner's jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, and Florentino ""Indian Charlie"" Cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of Morgan Earp. :250 Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a few trusted friends and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family as they traveled to Benson for a train ride to California. They found Stilwell lying in wait for Virgil in the Tucson station and killed him on the tracks. After killing Stilwell, Wyatt deputized others and rode on a vendetta, killing three more cowboys over the next few days before leaving the state.",What is the name of the sheriff who shot William Whitney Brazelton?

However, this has the result that there is no objective definition of what constitutes ""literature""; anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value-judgements can change over time.",What is the main component of the qualitative judgment definition of literature?

Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations.

They consider all other present-day religions to be false, identifying them with ""Babylon the Great"", or the ""harlot"", of Revelation 17, and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations, which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17. This development will mark the beginning of the ""great tribulation"". Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah's Witnesses, an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon, during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ's ""sheep"", or true followers, will be destroyed. After Armageddon, God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth, which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden. After Armageddon, most of those who had died before God's intervention will gradually be resurrected during ""judgment day"" lasting for one thousand years. This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds. At the end of the thousand years, Christ will hand all authority back to God. Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind. Those who fail will be destroyed, along with Satan and his demons. The end result will be a fully tested, glorified human race.",One of Jehovah Witnesses' central teachings is that the world entered into its last days at what year?

In 202 BC, internal problems led to a weakening of Egypt's position, thereby disrupting the power balance among the successor states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt. Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance. The delegation succeeded, even though prior Greek attempts to involve Rome in Greek affairs had been met with Roman apathy. Our primary source about these events, the surviving works of Polybius, do not state Rome's reason for getting involved. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome's new Greek allies.

Despite his recent successes against the Greeks and earlier successes against Rome, Philip's army buckled under the pressure from the Roman-Greek army.

The earliest fossil remains of true birds come from the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, but the dates for the actual splits are much debated by scientists. The Aves are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, but there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs. This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while fossil evidence supports a Cenozoic radiation. Attempts to reconcile the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial, but recent results show that all the extant groups of birds originated from only a small handful of species that survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction.",What is the superorder containing the Anseriformes?

",53,53,"At times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review, it is considered final. Yet, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.

  Positive charge +Q collects on one plate and negative charge −Q,"
When an electric field develops across the dielectric of a capacitor due to a potential difference (voltage) applied by a battery, charges accumulate on the plates in the following manner:

1. **Positive Charge on One Plate**: The plate connected to the positive terminal of the battery accumulates a positive charge (+Q). This is because the positive terminal of the battery repels the positive charges (or holes) in the conductor towards the plate, leading to a net positive charge on that plate.

2. **Negative Charge on the Other Plate**: Conversely, the plate connected to the negative terminal of the battery accumulates a negative charge (-Q). This occurs because the negative terminal of the battery repels the electrons in the conductor towards the plate, leading to a net negative charge on that plate.

This separation of charges creates an electric field across the dielectric, which opposes the external electric field from the battery. The process continues until the electric field created by the charge separation balances the external field, at which point the capacitor is said to be fully charged and no further current flows through the capacitor.","After an electric field develops across the dielectric of a capacitor, positive charge +","

After an electric field has developed across the dielectric, positive charge +Q accumulates","Charges accumulate on each plate of a capacitor after an electric field has developed across the dielectric due to the movement of electrons. In the case of a capacitor connected to a battery, positive charge (+Q) collects on one plate (usually the positive terminal of the battery) and negative charge (-Q) collects on the other plate (usually the negative terminal of the battery). This process is known as charging the capacitor. When the capacitor is fully charged, no current can flow through it, but if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a displacement current can flow.","After an electric field develops across the dielectric in a capacitor with a battery attached, positive charge (+Q) accumulates on the plate connected to the positive terminal of the battery, while negative charge (-Q) accumulates on the plate connected to the negative terminal of the battery. This happens because electrons (negative charges) get attracted to the nearer, positively charged plate and repelled by the faraway, negatively charged plate. Similarly, positive charges are attracted to the faraway, negatively charged plate and repelled by the nearer, positively charged plate. When the battery has been connected for a sufficient amount of time, no net current flows through the capacitor as the electric field becomes stable. However, if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a displacement current can flow due to the changing electric field.","After an electric field has developed across the dielectric of a capacitor, charges accumulate on each plate due to the potential difference created by the electric field. Positive charge +Q collects on one plate and negative charge −Q collects on the other plate. This occurs because the electric field causes the free electrons in the conductors to move towards the positive plate, leaving behind a net positive charge on the other plate. This process continues until the potential difference across the capacitor equals the voltage of the battery, at which point the capacitor is fully charged and no current can flow through it. However, if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, a displacement current can flow.",The charges accumulate on each plate of a capacitor because the electric field across the dielectric causes positive charge +Q to collect on one plate and negative charge −Q to collect on the other plate.,"After an electric field has developed across the dielectric, positive charge +Q accumulates on one plate of the capacitor and negative charge -Q accumulates on the other plate.","After an electric field develops across the dielectric, positive charge +Q accumulates on one plate and negative charge -Q accumulates on the other plate due to the electric field's influence, resulting in the separation of charges across the capacitor.",Positive charge +Q accumulates on one plate and negative charge -Q accumulates on the other plate of the capacitor after an electric field has developed across the dielectric.,"When a capacitor is connected to a battery, the electric field developed across the dielectric causes electrons to be pushed away from the positive terminal of the battery and accumulate on the plate connected to the negative terminal, resulting in a negative charge (−Q) on that plate. Simultaneously, electrons are pulled away from the plate connected to the positive terminal of the battery, leaving it with a positive charge (+Q). This accumulation of opposite charges on the two plates, separated by the dielectric, creates the electric field across the dielectric.","After an electric field develops across the dielectric of a capacitor:

- Positive charge (+Q) accumulates on one plate
- Negative charge (-Q) accumulates on the other plate

This charge separation occurs due to the potential difference applied across the conductors, such as when the capacitor is connected to a battery.","When an electric field develops across the dielectric of a capacitor due to a potential difference, charges accumulate on the plates through a process called polarization. The electric field causes the positive charges within the dielectric to shift slightly toward the negative plate, and the negative charges to shift slightly toward the positive plate.

These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical, they had a very short lifetime. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' and obtained British Patent 4933 in 1880. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.",What was the first public building to install electric lighting?

",Drilling holes,drilling holes,"Originally, every electronic component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then passed through the holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.",Which part of the Auto-Sembly manufacturing process is the most costly?

This means that a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current. If the applied voltage exceeds the LED's forward voltage drop by a small amount, the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount, potentially damaging or destroying the LED. The typical solution is to use constant-current power supplies to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating.

However, the high resistance of three-volt coin cells combined with the high differential resistance of nitride-based LEDs makes it possible to power such an LED from such a coin cell without an external resistor.",What can cause a large change in current in LEDs?

The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control it, at Milan. Milan was named as the place, here three hundred bishops assembled, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of Dionysius (bishop of Milan), and the two Papal Legates, viz., Eusebius of Vercelli and Lucifer of Cagliari, consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius. Those who refused were sent into exile. The decrees were forwarded to the Pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.",Did the Emperor agree to a new trial for Athanasius?

These may interface with endocrine glands of the brain to result in periodic release of hormones. The receptors for these hormones may be located far across the body and synchronise the peripheral clocks of various organs. Thus, the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain, and, through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised.

Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes, however there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency.

It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and ""win one for the Gipper."" The 1940 film, Knute Rockne, All American, starred Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp. Today the team competes in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December 11, 2009. Kelly's record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly's Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history.
